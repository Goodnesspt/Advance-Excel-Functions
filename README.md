I used functions like xlookuo, vlookup which i discover that xlookup function a lot better. 
I also discover that between 'if' and 'ifs', its more efficient to use 'ifs' than to use 'if' because 'ifs' performs what 'if' can do with some things that 'if' can't do. 
I used functions like and, or. I also worked with date and time of a data.
